The impact of the environment on graphene's properties such as strain, charge density, and dielectric environment can be evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. Variations, artifacts, and environmental differences pose a challenge in traditional spectral analysis. In this work, we developed a deep learning model to overcome the effects of such variations and classify graphene Raman spectra according to different charge densities and dielectric environments. We demonstrated the spectra classification with 99% accuracy using a convolutional neural net (CNN) model. Our approach has the potential for fast and reliable estimation of graphene doping levels and dielectric environments. The proposed model paves the way for achieving efficient analytical tools to evaluate the properties of graphene.
